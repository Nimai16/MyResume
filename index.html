<!-- Here's my feedback on your HTML resume, along with recommendations for improvement:

Good aspects:

Clear structure: The resume follows a logical hierarchy with headings and sections, making it easy to read and navigate.
Essential information: It includes all the key details that employers would look for, such as your name, title, contact information, work experience, education, skills, and achievements.
Professional tone: The language used is professional and concise, conveying your experience and skills effectively.
Recommendations:

1. Semantic Structure:

Employ more semantic HTML elements to better define the content's structure and meaning:
Use <header> for the top section containing your name, image, and links.
Use <main> for the main content area (work experience, education, etc.).
Use <footer> for the copyright information.

2. Formatting and Styling:

Introduce CSS for visual enhancements:
Adjust font sizes, colors, and spacing for better readability and visual appeal.
Consider using a subtle grid system to align elements and create a more polished layout.
Explore using a CSS reset or normalize stylesheet to ensure consistent styling across browsers.
3. Content Organization:

Rearrange sections for a stronger impact:
Consider moving your "Skills" section higher up, as it highlights your core proficiencies.

4. Achievement Emphasis:

Quantify your achievements whenever possible:
Instead of "Work closely with my management team to improve existing procedures," specify the number of procedures improved or the percentage of KPI targets met.
Use metrics to showcase the impact of your work.

5. Contact Information:

Provide direct contact details within the resume itself:
Include your email address and phone number directly, rather than linking to a separate contact page.
Make it easier for potential employers to reach you.

6. Proofreading:

Carefully proofread the text for typos and grammatical errors:
Ensure accuracy and professionalism in your presentation.
Additional Tips:

Use a consistent font family and style throughout the resume.

Consider adding a brief summary section at the beginning to highlight your key strengths and career goals.

If you have any relevant projects or portfolio items, include links to them within the resume.

Tailor your resume to specific job openings by emphasizing the skills and experience most relevant to each position.

Remember, even with only HTML, you can create a visually appealing and well-structured resume that effectively showcases your qualifications. By incorporating these suggestions, you can further enhance your resume's impact and increase your chances of landing interviews. -->
